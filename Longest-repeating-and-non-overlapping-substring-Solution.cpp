####################################################################################  Question  ################################################################################################

Given a string s of length n, find the longest repeating non-overlapping substring in it. In other words find 2 identical substrings of maximum length which do not overlap. Return the longest non-overlapping substring. Return "-1" if no such string exists.

Note: Multiple Answers are possible but you have to return the substring whose first occurrence is earlier.

For Example: "abhihiab", here both "ab" and "hi" are possible answers. But you will have to return "ab" because it's first occurrence appears before the first occurrence of "hi".

Example 1:

Input:
n = 9
s = "acdcdacdc"
Output:
"acdc"
Explanation:
The string "acdc" is the longest Substring of s which is repeating but not overlapping.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 7
s = "heheheh"
Output:
"heh"
Explanation:
The string "heh" is the longest Substring of s which is repeating but not overlapping.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function longestSubstring() which takes an Integer n and a string s as input and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n2)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 103
